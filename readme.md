# Three.js Floating Cubes Interaction

A 3D visual experiment built with Three.js.  
A large grid of cubes reacts to pointer movement, glowing and lifting with a wave-like animation.

### Features
- Hover-based interaction using raycasting
- Cubes within a radius glow and float upward with sinusoidal motion
- Smooth reset to resting position when pointer moves away
- Subtle bloom effect for enhanced visuals

This project was a technical and visual test to explore mass interaction, animated feedback, and bloom post-processing in a large scene.

**Tools:** Three.js, WebGL, UnrealBloomPass, Raycasting  
**Objects:** ~20,000+ individual cubes (no instancing used!)
